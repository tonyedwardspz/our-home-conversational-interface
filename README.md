# Our Home conversational interface

This is a conversational interface for managing both household and personal tasks.

## How it works
We've been using Todoist to manage household tasks for sometime. Unfortunately, the todoist action for the Google Nest
speaker ecosystem is cumbersome at best.

This project is to streamline the checking off and creation of tasks via the houses every room smart speaker system. The 
code in this repository is a DialogFlow fulfilment script and interfaces with a DialogFlow bot.

As it stands, it is only of use to me due to the bespoke nature of the way tasks are handled.

## Example Invocation

The use invokes the system by saying:

> Tell \<house name\> that Dexter has been fed

> Tell \<house name\> that I've learned some German
